"A robust, full-featured, and well-documented general-purpose library for "
"manipulating Open XML PowerPoint files."

"**full-featured** - Anything that the file format will allow can be "
"accomplished via the API. (Note that visions often take some time to "
"fulfill completely :)."

"**well-documented** - I don't know about you, but I find it hard to "
"remember what I was thinking yesterday if I don't write it down. That's "
"not a problem for most of my thinking, but when it comes to how I set up "
"an object hierarchy to interact, it can be a big time-waster. So I like "
"it when things are nicely laid out in black-and-white. Other folks seem "
"to like that too :)."

"**general-purpose** - Applicability to all conceivable purposes is valued"
" over being especially well-suited to any particular purpose. Particular "
"purposes can always be accomplished by building a wrapper library of your"
" own. Serving general purposes from a particularized library is not so "
"easy."

msgid ""
"**create AND manipulate** - While this library will perhaps most commonly"
" be used for *writing* .pptx files, it will also be suitable for "
"*reading* .pptx files and inspecting and manipulating their contents. I "
"could see that coming in handy for full-text indexing, removing speaker "
"notes, changing out templates, adding dynamically generated slides to "
"static boilerplate, that sort of thing."
