"An AutoShape has a text frame, referred to in the PowerPoint UI as the "
"shape's *Text Box*. One of the settings provided is *Autofit*, which can "
"be one of \"Do not autofit\", \"Resize text to fit shape\", or \"Resize "
"shape to fit text\". The scope of this analysis is how best to provide an"
" alternative to the \"Resize text to fit shape\" behavior that simply "
"resizes the text to the largest point size that will fit entirely within "
"the shape extents."

"This produces a similar visual effect, but the \"auto-size\" behavior "
