"In the Microsoft API, the term *chart group* is used for the concept "
"these elements represent. Rather than a group of charts, their role is "
"perhaps better described as a *series group*. The terminology is a bit "
"vexed when it comes down to details. The term *plot* was chosen for the "
"purposes of this library."

"The reason the concept of a plot is required is that more than one type "
"of plotting may appear on a single chart. For example, a line chart can "
"appear on top of a column chart. To be more precise, one or more series "
"can be plotted as lines superimposed on one or more series plotted as "
"columns."

"The two sets of series both belong to a single chart, and there is only a"

"Individual series can be assigned a different *chart type* using the "
"PowerPoint UI; this operation causes them to be placed in a distinct "
"`xChart` element of the corresponding type. During this operation, "
"PowerPoint adds `xChart` elements in an order that seems to correspond to"
" logical viewing order, without respect to the sequence of the series "
"chosen. It appears area plots are placed in back, bar next, and line in "
"front. This prevents plots of one type from obscuring the others."

"Note that not all combinations of chart types are possible. I've seen "
"area overlaid with column overlaid with line. Bar cannot be combined with"
" line, which seems sensible because their axes locations differ (switched"
" horizontal/vertical)."

"**Plot.vary_by_categories** -- Read/write boolean determining whether "

"series uses varying colors to distinguish series rather than categories."
