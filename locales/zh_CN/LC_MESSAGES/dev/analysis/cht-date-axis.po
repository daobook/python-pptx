"A date axis maintains a linear relationship between axis distance and "
"elapsed time in days, months, or years, even if the data items do not "
"include values for each base time unit. This is in contrast to a category"
" axis, which uses the independent axis values themselves to determine the"
" discrete set of categories."

"The date axis does this by essentially creating a \"logical category\" "
"for each base time unit in a range, whether the data contains a value for"
" that time unit or not."

"Variations in the number of days in a month (or year) is also taken care "

"This does not make the category axis continuous, however the \"grain\" of"
" the discrete units can be quite small in comparison to the axis length. "
"The individual base unit divisions can but are not typically represented "
"graphically. The granularity of major and minor divisions is specified as"
" a property on the date axis."
