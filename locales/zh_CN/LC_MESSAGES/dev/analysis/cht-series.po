msgid ""
"A series in a sequence of *points* that correspond to the categories of a"
" plot. A chart may have more than one series, which gives rise, for "
"example, to a *clustered column chart* or a line chart with multiple "
"lines plotted."

"A series belongs to a *plot*. When a chart has multiple plots, such as a "
"bar chart with a superimposed line plot, each of the series in the chart "
"belong to one plot or the other."

"Although the Microsoft API has a method on Chart to access all the series"
" in a chart, it also has the same method for accessing the series of a "
"plot (ChartGroup in MS API)."

"There are eight distinct series types, corresponding to major chart "
"types. They all share a common base of attributes and others appear on "
"one or more of the types."

"Each series in a chart has an explicit sequence indicator, the value of "
"its required `c:order` child element. The series for a plot appear in "
"order of this value. The series for a chart appear in plot order, then "
"their order within that plot, such that all series for the first plot "
"appear before those in the next plot, and so on."

"Perhaps counterintuitively, a Point object does not provide access to all"
" the attributes one might think. It only provides access to attributes of"
" the visual representation of the point in that chart, such as the color,"
" datum label, or marker. It does not provide access to the data point "
"values, such as the Y value or the bubble size."

"Surface charts do not have a distinct data point representation (rather "
"just an inflection in the surface. So series of surface charts will not "
"have the .points member. Since surface charts are not yet implemented, "
"this will come into play sometime later."

"Note that bubble and XY have a different way of organizing their data "
