" They each also have distinctive behaviors. The focus of this page is the"
" common slide characteristics."

"While this attribute is populated by PowerPoint in slide layouts, it is "
"commonly unpopulated in slides and slide masters. When a slide has no "
"explicit name, PowerPoint uses the default name 'Slide {n}', where *n* is"
" the sequence number of the slide in the current presentation. This name "
"is not written to the `p:cSlide/@name` attribute. In the outline pane, "
"PowerPoint uses the slide title if there is one."
