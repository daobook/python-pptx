"A *graphic frame* is a shape that contains a graphical object such as a "
"table, chart, or SmartArt object. While often referred to as a shape in "
"common parlance, a table or chart is not a shape. The graphic frame "
"container is the shape and the table, chart, or SmartArt object is a "
"DrawingML (DML) object within it."

"A chart, for example, is a shared DML object. It can appear in a Word, "
"Excel, or PowerPoint file, virtually unchanged except for the container "
"in which it appears."

"The graphical content is contained in the "
"``p:graphicFrame/a:graphic/a:graphicData`` grandchild element. The type "
"of graphical object contained is specified by an XML namespace contained "
"in the ``uri`` attribute of the ``<a:graphicData>`` element. The "
"graphical content may appear directly in the ``<p:graphicFrame>`` element"
" or may be in a separate part related by an rId. XML for a table is "
"embedded inline. Chart XML is stored in a related Chart part."
