"A chart may be understood as a graph of a function, formed by rendering a"
" finite number of ordered pairs (e.g. (x, y)) in one of several graphical"
" formats such as bar, pie, or bubble."

msgid "A functon can be expressed as::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/analysis/cht-points.rst:13
msgid ""
"where *x* is the input to the function and *y* is the output. *x* is "
"known more formally as the function's *argument*, and *y* as its *value*."
" The set of possible input (x) values is the *domain* of the function. "
"The set of possible output (y) values is the function's *range*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In PowerPoint, the function is perhaps rarely mathematical; perhaps more "
"commonly, the x and y values are correlated observations, facts to be "
"communicated graphically as a set. Still these terms borrowed from "
"mathematics provide convenient language for describing aspects of "
"PowerPoint charts."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/analysis/cht-points.rst:24
msgid ""
"PowerPoint charts can be divided broadly into *category* types, which "
"take a discrete argument, and *XY* (aka. scatter) types which take a "
"continuous argument. For category types, the argument is one of a "
"discrete set of categories, expressed as a label, such as \"Blue\", "
"\"Red\", and \"Green\". The argument for an XY type is a real number. In "
"both cases, the *value* of each data point is a real number."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/analysis/cht-points.rst:31
msgid ""
"The argument is commonly associated with the horizontal axis of the chart"
" and the value with the vertical axis; these would be the X and Y axis "
"respectively on an XY chart. However the 2D orientation of the axes is "
"reversed in some char types (bar charts in particular) and takes other "
"forms in chart types such as radar and doughnut. In the MS API, the axis "
"associated with the argument is known as the *category axis* and the "
"other is the *value axis*. This terminology is used across all chart "
"types (including XY) as a matter of convention."

msgid "Series"
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/analysis/cht-points.rst:44
msgid ""
"A chart can have one or more series. A series is a set of ordered pairs "
"that are related in some way and meant to be distinguished graphically on"
" the chart, often so they can be compared. For example, one series could "
"represent Q1 financial results, depicted as a blue line, and a second "
"series represent Q2 financial results with a red line."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/analysis/cht-points.rst:50
msgid ""
"In a standard chart, all series share the same domain (e.g. the same X "
"axis). In a category chart, all series also share the same set of "
"categories. In an XY chart, the domain values are continuous; so in "
"general, each data point in each XY series will in have a distinct "
"argument (x value)."
