"One common case is for the categories in a \"horizontal\" bar-chart (as "
"opposed to the \"vertical\" column-chart). Because the value axis appears"
" at the bottom, categories appear from bottom-to-top on the categories "
"axis. For many readers this is odd, perhaps because we read top-to-"
"bottom."
