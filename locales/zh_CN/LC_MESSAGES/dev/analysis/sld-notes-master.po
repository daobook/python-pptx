"In the PowerPoint UI, a notes item is called a \"notes page\"; internally"
" however, it is referred to as a \"notes slide\", is based on the Slide "
"object, and shares many behaviors with it such as containing shapes and "
"inheriting from a master."

"A notes slide is created on-first use, perhaps most frequently by typing "
"text into the notes pane. When a new notes slide is created, it is based "
"on the notes master. If no notes master is yet present, a new one is "
"created from an internal PowerPoint-preset default and added to the "
"package."

msgid ""
"When a notes slide is created from the notes master, certain placeholders"
" are partially \"cloned\" from the master. All other placeholders and "
"shapes remain only on the master. The cloning process only creates "
"placeholder shapes on the notes slide, but does not copy position or size"
" information or other formatting. By default, position, size, and other "
"formatting is inherited from the corresponding master placeholder. This "
"achieves consistency through a presentation."

"A notes slide maintains a relationship with the master it was created "

"A master can contain at most one each of six different placeholders: "
"slide image, notes (textbox), header, footer, date, and slide number. The"
" header, footer, and date placeholders are not copied to the notes slide "
"by default. These three placeholders can be individually shown or hidden "
"(copied to or deleted from the notes slide actually) using the Insert > "
"Header and Footer... menu option/dialog. This dialog is also available "
"from the Page Setup dialog."

"All other items on the notes master, such as background "
"color/texture/image and any additional text boxes or other shapes such as"
