"The slides in a presentation are owned by the presentation object. In "
"particular, the unique identifier of a slide, the slide id, is assigned "
"and managed by the presentation part, and is not recorded in the slide "
"XML."

"PowerPoint assigns a unique integer identifier to a slide when it is "
"created. Note that this identifier is only present in the presentation "
"part, and maps to a relationship ID; it is not recorded in the XML of the"
" slide itself. Therefore the identifier is only unique within a "
"presentation. The ID takes the form of an integer starting at 256 and "
"incrementing by one for each new slide. Changing the ordering of the "
"slides does not change the id. The id of a deleted slide is not reused, "
"although I'm not sure whether it's clever enough not to reuse the id of "
"the last added slide when it's been deleted as there doesn't seem to be "
"any record in the XML of the max value assigned."
