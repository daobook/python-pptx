"A slide may have an associated notes page. The notes it contains are "
"displayed under the slide in the PowerPoint UI when in edit mode. The "
"slide notes are also shown in presenter mode, are displayed in Notes "
"Pages view, and are printed on those notes pages."

"Internally, a notes page is referred to as a *notes slide*. This is "
"sensible because it is actually a specialized instance of a slide. It "
"contains shapes, many of which are placeholders, and allows inserting of "
"new shapes such as auto shapes, tables, and charts (although it is "
"probably not common). Much of the functionality for a notes slide is "
"inherited from existing base classes."

"A notes slide is created using the notes master as a template. A "
"presentation has no notes master when created from a template in "
"PowerPoint. One is created according to a PowerPoint-internal preset "
"default the first time it is needed, which is generally when a notes "
"slide is created. It's possible one can also be created by entering the "
"Notes Master view and almost certainly is created by editing the master "
"found there (haven't tried it though). A presentation can have at most "
"one notes master."

"On creation, certain placeholders (slide image, notes, slide number) are "
"copied from the notes master onto the new notes slide (if they have not "
"been removed from the master). These \"cloned\" placeholders inherit "
"position, size, and formatting from their corresponding notes master "
"placeholder. If the position, size, or formatting of a notes slide "
"placeholder is changed, the changed property is no long inherited "
"(unchanged properties, however, continue to be inherited)."

"The remaining three placeholders that can appear on the notes master "
"(date, header text, footer text) can optionally be made to appear on an "
"individual notes slide using the Header and Footer... dialog. This dialog"
" also has a button allowing all notes slides to be updated with the "
"selected options. There appears to be some heuristic logic that "
"automatically propagates these settings to notes for new slides as they "
"are created."

"A notes slide is not automatically created for each slide. Rather it is "
