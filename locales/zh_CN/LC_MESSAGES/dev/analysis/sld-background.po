"**Access slide background.** `Slide.background` is the `Background` "
"object for the slide. Its presence is unconditional and the same "
"`Background` object is provided on each access for a particular `Slide` "
"instance. Its presence does not imply an explicitly applied slide "

"**Detect explicitly-applied slide background.** A slide inherits its "
"background unless an explicitly-defined background has been applied to "
"the slide. The presence of an \"override\" background is determined by "
"interrogating the `.follow_master_background` property on each slide::"

"**Override inheritance of background.** Assigning `False` to "
"`.follow_master_background` adds a \"blank\" background to the slide, "

"Note that this step is not necessary to override inheritance. Merely "
"specifying a background fill will also interrupt inheritance. This "
"approach might be the easiest way though, if all you want is to interrupt"
" inheritance and don't want to apply a particular fill."

"**Access background fill.** The `FillFormat` object for a slide "
"background is accessed using the background's `.fill` property. Note that"
" merely accessing this property will suppress inheritance of background "

"little reason to access the property without intention to change it::"
