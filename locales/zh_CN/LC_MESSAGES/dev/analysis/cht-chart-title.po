"A chart can have a title. The title is a rich text container, and can "
"contain arbitrary text with arbitrary formatting (font, size, color, "
"etc.). There is little but one thing to distinquish a chart title from an"
" independent text box; its position is automatically adjusted by the "
"chart to account for resizing and movement."
