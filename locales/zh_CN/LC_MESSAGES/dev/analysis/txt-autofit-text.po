"An AutoShape has a text frame, referred to in the PowerPoint UI as the "
"shape's *Text Box*. One of the settings provided is *Autofit*, which can "
"be one of \"Do not autofit\", \"Resize text to fit shape\", or \"Resize "
"shape to fit text\". The scope of this analysis is how best to implement "
"the \"Resize text to fit shape\" behavior."

"A robust implementation would be complex and would lead the project "
"outside the currently intended scope. In particular, because the shape "
"size, text content, the \"full\" point size of the text, and the autofit "
"and wrap settings of the text frame all interact to determine the proper "
"\"fit\" of adjusted text, all events that could change the state of any "
"of these five factors would need to be coupled to an \"update\" method. "
"There would also need to be at least two \"fitting\" algorithms, one for "
"when wrap was turned on and another for when it was off."

"The initial solution we'll pursue is a special-purpose method on "
"TextFrame that reduces the permutations of these variables to one and "
"places responsibility on the developer to call it at the appropriate "
"time. The method will calculate based on the current text and shape size,"
" set wrap on, and set auto_size to fit text to the shape. If any of the "
"variables change, the developer will be responsible for re-calling the "
"method."

"**.fit_text() or .autofit_text().** Two related methods are used to fit "
"text in a shape using different approaches. ``TextFrame.autofit_text()`` "
"uses the `TEXT_TO_FIT_SHAPE` autofit setting to shrink a full-size "
"paragraph of text. Later edits to that text using PowerPoint will re-fit "
"the text automatically, up to the original (full-size) font size."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/analysis/txt-autofit-text.rst:57
msgid ""
"``TextFrame.fit_text()`` takes the approach of simply setting the font "
"size for all text in the shape to the best-fit size. No automatic "
"resizing occurs on later edits in PowerPoint, although the user can "
"switch on auto-fit for that text box, perhaps after setting the full-size"
" point size to their preferred size."

"**Auto-locate installed font file.** Search for and use the appropriate "

"Windows, the font directory can be located using a registry key, and is "
