"A movie is implemented as a variant form of a `p:pic` element, which "
"makes it closely related to a `Picture` object. This close relationship "
"makes sense, because a movie acts very much like an image when it is not "
"playing and the two shapes therefore share much of their behavior. When "
"not playing, a movie shape displays a static image, called a *poster "
"frame*."
