"The bar chart is a fundamental plot type, used for both column and bar "
"charts by specifying the bar direction. It is also used for the "
"clustered, stacked, and stacked 100% varieties by specifying grouping and"

"A gap appears between the bar or clustered bars for each category on a "
"bar chart. The default width for this gap is 150% of the bar width. It "
"can be set between 0 and 500% of the bar width. In the MS API this is set"
" using the property `ChartGroup.GapWidth`."

"In a bar chart having two or more series, the bars for each category are "

"The bars can be made to overlap each other or have a space between them "
"using the *overlap* property. Its values range between -100 and 100, "
"representing the percentage of the bar width by which to overlap adjacent"
" bars. A setting of -100 creates a gap of a full bar width and a setting "
"of 100 causes all the bars in a category to be superimposed. The default "
"value is 0."
