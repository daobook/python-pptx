"PowerPoint AutoShapes, such as rectangles, circles, and triangles, have a"
" *preset* geometry. The user simply picks from a selection of some 160 "
"pre-defined shapes to place one on the slide, at which point they can be "
"scaled. Many shapes allow their geometry to be adjusted in certain ways "

"PowerPoint also supports a much less commonly used but highly flexible "

"**Closing a contour.** A contour is only *truly* closed if it ends with a"
" `<a:close>` element. It can *appear* closed if its end point is the same"
" as its start point, but close inspection of the line-ends will reveal "
"there is no smooth transition around the starting corner. This is more "
"apparent when a wide line style is used for the outline."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/analysis/shp-freeform.rst:207
msgid ""
"A `<a:close>` element will cause a straight line segment to be drawn "
"between the last point point of the contour and the first. So it's not "
"necessary to repeat the first point as the last one if a straight line "
"segment suits. The advantage is small however, and might only be an "
"optimization to consider when thousands of freeform shapes were being "
