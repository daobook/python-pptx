"Lines are a sub-category of auto shape that differ in certain properties "

"Connectors are based on the ``<p:cxnSp>`` element and have one of a "
"handful of different preset geometry values, such as ``line``. Freeform "
"connectors, despite the name, are not connectors, and are a custom "
"geometry shape based on the p:sp element."

"Connectors can be \"connected\" to an auto shape such that a connected "
"end point remains connected when the auto shape is moved. This relies on "
"a concept of \"connection points\" on the auto shape. These connections "
"points are preset features of the auto shape, similar to how adjustment "
"points are pre-defined. Connection points are identified by index."
