"The data behind a chart--its category labels and its series names and "
"values--turns out to be a pivotal object in both the construction of a "
"new chart and updating the data behind an existing chart."

"The first role of |ChartData| is to act as a data transfer object, "
"allowing the data for a chart to be accumulated over multiple calls such "
"as `.add_series()`. This avoids the need to assemble and send a complex "
"nested structure of primitives to method calls."

"In addition to this, |ChartData| also takes on the role of broker to "
"|ChartXmlWriter| and |WorkbookWriter| which know how to assemble the "
"``<c:chartSpace>`` XML and Excel workbook for a chart, respectively. This"
" is sensible because neither of these objects can operate without a chart"
" data instance to provide the data they need and doing so concentrates "
"the coupling to the latter two objects into one place."

"A |ChartData| object is constructed directly as needed, and used for "
