"A paragraph has three spacing properties. It can have spacing that "
"separates it from the prior paragraph, spacing that separates it from the"
" following paragraph, and line spacing less than or greater than the "
"default single line spacing."

"The units of the return value can be distinguished by its type. In "
"practice, units can also be distinguished by magnitude. Lines are "

"In practice, line values will rarely be greater than 3.0 and it would be "
"hard to imagine a useful line spacing less than 1 pt (12700). If "
"magnitude is the most convenient discriminator, 256 can be assumed to be "
"a safe threshold value."
