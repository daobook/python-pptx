"I'm not sure why the category labels are redundantly applied to each "
"series, but the fact that they are leads me to believe I must be missing "
"something; I don't believe they would repeat them like that if there "
"wasn't a situation in which they could be different between two series in"
" the same plot."

"Consequently, there might be some edge cases where this won't work quite "
"as expected. At the same time, I expect it will work exactly as expected "
"for 99.9% of the cases, maybe 99.99%."

"Categories are not enforced to be strictly hierarchical. So if a higher-"
"level category \"breaks\" (gets a new value) without also a new value at "
"the next level, the results might be a little weird. Like changing from "
"USA to Canada, but leaving NY as the state (by leaving that cell blank)."

"Basically, the meaning of a structure like this is ambiguous. PowerPoint "
"interprets it without error and python-pptx interprets it without error, "
"but the results might not exactly match up. PowerPoint seems to take the "
"senior category break and show the intermediate category as blank or "
"'None'. But I suppose it could be interpreted as the senior category just"
" splits a subordinate one; it's open to some question."
