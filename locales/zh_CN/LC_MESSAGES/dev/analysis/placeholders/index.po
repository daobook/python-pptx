"From a user perspective, a placeholder is a container into which content "
"can be inserted. The position, size, and formatting of content inserted "
"into the placeholder is determined by the placeholder, allowing those key"
" presentation design characteristics to be determined at design time and "
"kept consistent across presentations created from a particular template."

msgid ""
"The placeholder appearing on a slide is only part of the overall "
"placeholder mechanism however. Placeholder behavior requires three "
"different categories of placeholder shape; those that exist on a slide "
"master, those on a slide layout, and those that ultimately appear on a "
"slide in a presentation."

"These three categories of placeholder participate in a property "
"inheritance hierarchy, either as an inheritor, an inheritee, or both. "
"Placeholder shapes on masters are inheritees only. Conversely placeholder"
" shapes on slides are inheritors only. Placeholders on slide layouts are "
"both, a possible inheritor from a slide master placeholder and an "
"inheritee to placeholders on slides linked to that layout."

"copyright text, and slide background, but these can be reapplied "
"individually directly to that slide layout. Since the title slide layout "
"is generally the only one folks want to hide a slide number from, this is"

"In every case, these placeholders are copied, although some attributes "
"may be inherited at run time (not sure). Footer items are copied from the"
" master to a new layout. Likewise, items are copied from a layout to a "

"Footer. PowerPoint sometimes adds these automatically when they're "
