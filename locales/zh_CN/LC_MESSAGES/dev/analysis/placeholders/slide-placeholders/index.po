"A placeholder shape on a slide is initially little more than a reference "
"to its \"parent\" placeholder shape on the slide layout. If it is a "
"placeholder shape that can accept text, it contains a `<p:txBody>` "
"element. Position, size, and even geometry are inherited from the layout "
"placeholder, which may in turn inherit one or more of those properties "
"from a master placeholder."

"Content may be placed into a placeholder shape two ways, by *insertion* "
"and by *substitution*. Insertion is simply placing the text insertion "
"point in the placeholder and typing or pasting in text. Substitution "
"occurs when an object such as a table or picture is inserted into a "
"placeholder by clicking on a placeholder button."

msgid ""
"An empty placeholder is always a `<p:sp>` (autoshape) element. When an "
"object such as a table is inserted into the placehoder by clicking on a "
"placeholder button, the `<p:sp>` element is replaced with the appropriate"
" new shape element, a table element in this case. The `<p:ph>` element is"
" retained in the new shape element and preserves the linkage to the "
"layout placeholder such that the 'empty' placeholder shape can be "
"restored if the inserted object is deleted."
