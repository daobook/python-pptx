"Slides were created based on a variety of slide layouts so their "
"placeholder elements could be inspected to reveal slide construction "
"behaviors that depend on the slide layout chosen. A placeholder shape "
"appeared in each slide corresponding to each of the placeholder shapes in"
" the slide layout, excepting those of footer, date, and slide number "
"type. Placeholder shapes were ``<p:sp>`` elements for all placeholder "
"types rather than matching the element type of the shape they hold a "
"place for. Each slide-side placeholder had a ``<p:ph>`` element that "
"exactly matched the corresponding element in the slide layout, with the "
"exception that a *hasCustomPrompt* attribute, if present in the slide "
"layout, did not appear in the slide. Placeholders in the slide were named"
" and numbered differently. All placeholders in the slide layout had a "
"``<p:txBody>`` element, but only certain types had one in the slide. All "
"placeholders were locked against grouping."
