"A picture placeholder is an unpopulated placeholder into which an image "
"can be inserted. This comprises three concrete placeholder types, a "
"picture placeholder, a clip art placeholder, and a content placeholder. "
"Each of these, and indeed any unpopulated placeholder, take the form of a"
" `p:sp` element in the XML. Once populated with an image, these "
"placeholders become a *placeholder picture* and take the form of a "
"`p:pic` element."
