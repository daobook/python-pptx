"*AutoShape* is the name the MS Office API uses for a shape with preset "
"geometry, those referred to in the PowerPoint UI simply as *shape*. "
"Typical examples are a rectangle, a circle, or a star shape. An auto "
"shape has a type (preset geometry), an outline line style, a fill, and an"
" effect, in addition to a position and size. The outline, fill, and "
"effect can each be None."

"There are 187 pre-defined auto shape types, each corresponding to a "
"distinct preset geometry. Some types have one or more *adjustment value*,"
" which corresponds to the position of an adjustment handle (small yellow "
"diamond) on the shape in the UI that changes an aspect of the shape "
"geometry, for example the corner radius of a rounded rectangle."

"Many auto shapes may be adjusted to change their shape beyond just their "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In general, the nominal adjustment value range for the preset shapes is 0"
" to 100000. However, the actual value stored can be outside that range, "
"depending on the formulas involved. For example, in the case of the "
"chevron shape, the range is from 0 to 100000 * width / short-side. When "
"the shape is taller than it is wide, width is the short side and the "
"range is 0 to 100000. However, when the shape is wider than it is tall, "
"the range can be much larger. Required values are probably best "
"discovered via experimentation or calculation based on the preset "
"formula."

"The |gd| element does not appear initially when the shape is inserted. "
"However, if the adjustment handle is moved and then moved back to the "
"default value, the |gd| element is not removed. The default value becomes"
" the effective value for the guide if the |gd| element is not present."
msgstr ""

#: ../../dev/analysis/shp-autoshape.rst:79
msgid ""
"The adjustment value is preserved over scaling of the object. Its "
"effective value can change however, depending on the formula. In the case"
" of the chevron shape, the effective value is a function of ``ss``, the "
"\"short side\", and the adjustment handle moves on screen when the "
"chevron is made wider than it is tall."
