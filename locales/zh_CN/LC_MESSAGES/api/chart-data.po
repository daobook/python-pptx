"A ChartData object is used to specify the data depicted in a chart. It is"
" used when creating a new chart and when replacing the data for an "
"existing chart. Most charts are created using a |CategoryChartData| "
"object, however the data for XY and bubble chart types is different "
"enough that those each require a distinct chart data object."
msgstr ""

#: of pptx.chart.data.ChartData:1
msgid ""
"|ChartData| is simply an alias for |CategoryChartData| and may be removed"
" in a future release. All new development should use |CategoryChartData| "
"for creating or replacing the data in chart types other than XY and "
"Bubble."

#: of pptx.chart.data.CategoryChartData:1
msgid ""
"Accumulates data specifying the categories and series values for a chart "

":meth:`Chart.replace_data`."

msgid ""
"This object is suitable for use with category charts, i.e. all those "
"having a discrete set of label values (categories) as the range of their "
"independent variable (X-axis) values. Unlike the ChartData types for "
"charts supporting a continuous range of independent variable values (such"
" as XyChartData), CategoryChartData has a single collection of category "
"(X) values and each data point in its series specifies only the Y value. "
"The corresponding X value is inferred by its position in the sequence."
