"Not all shapes can contain text, but those that do always have at least "
"one paragraph, even if that paragraph is empty and no text is visible "
"within the shape. ``_BaseShape.has_text_frame`` can be used to determine "
"whether a shape can contain text. (All shapes subclass ``_BaseShape``.) "
"When ``_BaseShape.has_text_frame`` is ``True``, "
"``_BaseShape.text_frame.paragraphs[0]`` returns the first paragraph. The "
"text of the first paragraph can be set using "
"``text_frame.paragraphs[0].text``. As a shortcut, the writable properties"
" ``_BaseShape.text`` and ``_TextFrame.text`` are provided to accomplish "
"the same thing. Note that these last two calls delete all the shape's "
"paragraphs except the first one before setting the text it contains."
