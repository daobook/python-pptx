"The use case that drove me to begin work on this library has been to "
"automate the building of slides that are tedious to compose by hand. As "
"an example, consider the task of composing a slide with an array of 10 "
"headshot images of folks in a particular department, with the person's "
"name and title next to their picture. After doing this a dozen times and "
"struggling to get all the alignment and sizes to the point where my "
"attention to detail is satisfied, well, my coding fingers got quite "
"itchy."

"However I believe a broader application will be server-side document "
"generation on non-Windows server platforms, Linux primarily I expect. In "
"my organization, I have found an apparently insatiable demand for "
"PowerPoint documents as a means of communication. Once one rises beyond "
"the level of project manager it seems the willingness to interpret text "
"longer than a bullet point atrophies quite rapidly and PowerPoint becomes"
" an everyday medium. I've imagined it might be pretty cool to be able to "
"generate a \"presentation-ready\" deck for a salesperson that includes a "
"particular subset of the product catalog they could generate with a few "
"clicks to use in a sales presentation, for example. As you come up with "
"applications I'd love to hear about them."
