"The use case that drove me to begin work on this library has been to "
"automate the building of slides that are tedious to compose by hand. As "
"an example, consider the task of composing a slide with an array of 10 "
"headshot images of folks in a particular department, with the person's "
"name and title next to their picture. After doing this a dozen times and "
"struggling to get all the alignment and sizes to the point where my "
"attention to detail is satisfied, well, my coding fingers got quite "
"itchy."

"驱使我开始这个库工作的用例是，自动构建手工编写的冗长乏味的幻灯片。"
"例如，考虑这样一项任务：编写幻灯片，其中包含特定部门人员的 10 张头像数组，照片旁边是该人员的姓名和头衔。"
"在这样做了十几次之后，为了让所有的对齐方式和大小都能满足我对细节的关注，我的编码手指开始发痒了。"

"However I believe a broader application will be server-side document "
"generation on non-Windows server platforms, Linux primarily I expect. In "
"my organization, I have found an apparently insatiable demand for "
"PowerPoint documents as a means of communication. Once one rises beyond "
"the level of project manager it seems the willingness to interpret text "
"longer than a bullet point atrophies quite rapidly and PowerPoint becomes"
" an everyday medium. I've imagined it might be pretty cool to be able to "
"generate a \"presentation-ready\" deck for a salesperson that includes a "
"particular subset of the product catalog they could generate with a few "
"clicks to use in a sales presentation, for example. As you come up with "
"applications I'd love to hear about them."

"然而，我相信更广泛的应用将是在非 windows 服务器平台上的服务器端文档生成，我主要希望是 Linux。"
"在我的公司里，我发现对 PowerPoint 文档作为沟通手段的需求显然是无法满足的。"
"一旦一个人升到了项目经理的级别，他解释文字的意愿就会迅速下降，PowerPoint 就会成为一种日常媒介。"
"我曾经想象过，如果能够为销售人员生成演示文稿准备好的套件，其中包括产品目录的特定子集，"
"例如，他们只需点击几下鼠标就可以生成用于销售演示的产品。当你提出申请时，我很乐意听到。"
