"A slide can have notes associated with it. These are perhaps most "
"commonly encountered in the notes pane, below the slide in PowerPoint "
"\"Normal\" view where it may say \"Click to add notes\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:9
msgid ""
"The notes added here appear each time that slide is present in the main "
"pane. They also appear in *Presenter View* and in *Notes Page* view, both"
" available from the menu."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:13
msgid ""
"Notes can contain rich text, commonly bullets, bold, varying font sizes "
"and colors, etc. The Notes Page view has somewhat more powerful tools for"
" editing the notes text than the note pane in Normal view."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:17
msgid ""
"In the API and the underlying XML, the object that contains the text is "
"known as a *Notes Slide*. This is because internally, a notes slide is "
"actually a specialized instance of a slide. It contains shapes, many of "
"which are placeholders, and allows inserting of new shapes such as "
"pictures (a logo perhaps) auto shapes, tables, and charts. Consequently, "
"working with a notes slide is very much like working with a regular "
"slide."

"Each slide can have zero or one notes slide. A notes slide is created the"
" first time it is used, generally perhaps by adding notes text to a "
"slide. Once created, it stays, even if all the text is deleted."

msgid "The Notes Master"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:31
msgid ""
"A new notes slide is created using the *Notes Master* as a template. A "
"presentation has no notes master when newly created in PowerPoint. One is"
" created according to a PowerPoint-internal preset default the first time"
" it is needed, which is generally when the first notes slide is created. "
"It's possible one can also be created by entering the Notes Master view "
"and almost certainly is created by editing the master found there "
"(haven't tried it though). A presentation can have at most one notes "
"master."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:39
msgid ""
"The notes master governs the look and feel of notes pages, which can be "
"viewed on-screen but are really designed for printing out. So if you want"
" your notes page print-outs to look different from the default, you can "
"make a lot of customizations by editing the notes master. You access the "
"notes master editor using View > Master > Notes Master on the menu (on my"
" version at least). Notes slides created using |pp| will have the look "
"and feel of the notes master in the presentation file you opened to "
"create the presentation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:47
msgid ""
"On creation, certain placeholders (slide image, notes, slide number) are "
"copied from the notes master onto the new notes slide (if they have not "
"been removed from the master). These \"cloned\" placeholders inherit "
"position, size, and formatting from their corresponding notes master "
"placeholder. If the position, size, or formatting of a notes slide "
"placeholder is changed, the changed property is no long inherited "
"(unchanged properties, however, continue to be inherited)."

"Enough talk, let's show some code. Let's say you have a slide you're "

msgid "Alright, simple enough. Let's look at what happened here:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:72
msgid ""
"``slide.notes_slide`` gave us the notes slide. In this case, it first "
"created that notes slide based on the notes master. If there was no notes"
" master, it created that too. So a lot of things can happen behind the "
"scenes with this call the first time you call it, but if we called it "
"again it would just give us back the reference to the same notes slide, "
"which it caches, once retrieved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:79
msgid ""
"``notes_slide.notes_text_frame`` gave us the |TextFrame| object that "
"contains the actual notes. The reason it's not just "
"``notes_slide.text_frame`` is that there are potentially more than one. "
"What this is doing behind the scenes is finding the placeholder shape "
"that contains the notes (as opposed to the slide image, header, slide "
"number, etc.) and giving us *that* particular text frame."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:86
msgid ""
"A text frame in a notes slide works the same as one in a regular slide. "
"More precisely, a text frame on a shape in a notes slide works the same "
"as in any other shape. We used the ``.text`` property to quickly pop some"
" text in there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:91

"Using the text frame, you can add an arbitrary amount of text, formatted "
"however you want."

"This notes placeholder is just like a body placeholder we saw a couple "
"sections back. You can change its position, size, and many other "
"attributes, as well as get at its text via its text frame."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:107
msgid "You can also access the other placeholders::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:116
msgid "and also the shapes (a superset of the placeholders)::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/notes.rst:125
msgid ""
"In the common case, the notes slide contains only placeholders. However, "
"if you added an image, for example, to the notes slide, that would show "
"up as well. Note that if you added that image to the notes master, "
"perhaps a logo, it would appear on the notes slide \"visually\", but "
"would not appear as a shape in the notes slide shape collection. Rather, "
"it is visually \"inherited\" from the notes master."
