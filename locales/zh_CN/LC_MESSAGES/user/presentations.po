"|pp| allows you to create new presentations as well as make changes to "
"existing ones. Actually, it only lets you make changes to existing "
"presentations; it's just that if you start with a presentation that "
"doesn't have any slides, it feels at first like you're creating one from "
"scratch."

"|pp| 允许您创建新的演示文稿，以及对现有的演示文稿进行更改。"

"However, a lot of how a presentation looks is determined by the parts "
"that are left when you delete all the slides, specifically the theme, the"
" slide master, and the slide layouts that derive from the master. Let's "
"walk through it a step at a time using examples, starting with the two "
"things you can do with a presentation, open it and save it."

"然而，演示文稿的外观在很大程度上是由删除所有幻灯片后剩下的部分决定的，特别是主题、幻灯片母片和从幻灯片母片派生出来的幻灯片布局。"
"让我们通过例子一步一步地来了解它，从你可以对演示文稿做的两件事开始，打开并保存它。"

"The so-called \"default template\" is actually just a PowerPoint file "
"that doesn't have any slides in it, stored with the installed |pp| "
"package. It's the same as what you would get if you created a new "
"presentation from a fresh PowerPoint install, a 4x3 aspect ratio "
"presentation based on the \"White\" template. Well, except it won't "
"contain any slides. PowerPoint always adds a blank first slide by "
"default."

"and save just fine. The feature set is still being built out, so you "
