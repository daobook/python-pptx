"|pp| allows you to create new presentations as well as make changes to "
"existing ones. Actually, it only lets you make changes to existing "
"presentations; it's just that if you start with a presentation that "
"doesn't have any slides, it feels at first like you're creating one from "
"scratch."

"|pp| 允许您创建新的演示文稿，以及对现有的演示文稿进行更改。"

"However, a lot of how a presentation looks is determined by the parts "
"that are left when you delete all the slides, specifically the theme, the"
" slide master, and the slide layouts that derive from the master. Let's "
"walk through it a step at a time using examples, starting with the two "
"things you can do with a presentation, open it and save it."
msgstr ""
"然而，演示文稿的外观在很大程度上是由删除所有幻灯片后剩下的部分决定的，特别是主题、幻灯片母片和从幻灯片母片派生出来的幻灯片布局。"
"让我们通过例子一步一步地来了解它，从你可以对演示文稿做的两件事开始，打开并保存它。"

"The so-called \"default template\" is actually just a PowerPoint file "
"that doesn't have any slides in it, stored with the installed |pp| "
"package. It's the same as what you would get if you created a new "
"presentation from a fresh PowerPoint install, a 4x3 aspect ratio "
"presentation based on the \"White\" template. Well, except it won't "
"contain any slides. PowerPoint always adds a blank first slide by "
"default."
msgstr ""
"所谓的默认模板实际上只是 PowerPoint 文件，里面没有任何幻灯片，存储在已安装的 python-pptx 包中。"
"这与你从全新的 PowerPoint 安装中创建新的演示文稿时所得到的效果是一样的，"
"基于 \"White\" 模板的 4x3 宽高比演示文稿。"
"好吧，但它不包含任何幻灯片。默认情况下，PowerPoint 总是会添加一张空白页作为第一张幻灯片。"

"We've called it a *template*, but in fact it's just a regular PowerPoint "

msgstr ""
"我们称它为 **模板**，但实际上它只是普通的 PowerPoint 文件，删除了所有的幻灯片。"
"和实际的 PowerPoint 模板文件（``.potx``）有点不同。"

"You can open any PowerPoint 2007 or later file this way (.ppt files from "

"and save just fine. The feature set is still being built out, so you "
"can't add or change things like Notes Pages yet, but if the presentation "
"has them |pp| is polite enough to leave them alone and smart enough to "
"save them without actually understanding what they are."

"你可以用这种方式打开任何 PowerPoint 2007 及以后版本的文件（PowerPoint 2003 及以前版本的 .ppt 文件不行）。"
"虽然您可能还不能操作所有的内容，但已经存在的内容都可以加载和保存。"
"功能集仍在构建中，所以你还不能添加或更改像 Notes Pages 这样的东西，但如果演示文稿已经有了这些功能，"
"那么 |pp| 就会礼貌地不去理会它们，而聪明地在不了解它们是什么的情况下保存它们。"
