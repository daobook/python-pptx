"Intuitively, a placeholder is a pre-formatted container into which "
"content can be placed. By providing pre-set formatting to its content, it"
" places many of the formatting choices in the hands of the template "
"designer while allowing the end-user to concentrate on the actual "
"content. This speeds the presentation development process while "
"encouraging visual consistency in slides created from the same template."
msgstr ""
"直观地说，占位符是可以放置内容的预格式化容器。"
"通过为内容提供预先设置的格式，它将许多格式选择交给了模板设计人员，同时允许最终用户专注于实际的内容。"
"这加快了演示文稿的开发过程，同时鼓励从相同模板创建的幻灯片的视觉一致性。"
