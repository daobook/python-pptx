"Intuitively, a placeholder is a pre-formatted container into which "
"content can be placed. By providing pre-set formatting to its content, it"
" places many of the formatting choices in the hands of the template "
"designer while allowing the end-user to concentrate on the actual "
"content. This speeds the presentation development process while "
"encouraging visual consistency in slides created from the same template."

"While their typical end-user behaviors are relatively simple, the "
"structures that support their operation are more complex. This page is "
"for those who want to better understand the architecture of the "
"placeholder subsystem and perhaps be less prone to confusion at its "
"sometimes puzzling behavior. If you don't care why they work and just "
"want to know how to work with them, you may want to skip forward to the "
"following page :ref:`placeholders-using`."

"Placeholders are an orthogonal category of shape, which is to say "
"multiple shape types can be placeholders. In particular, the auto shape "
"(`p:sp` element), picture (`p:pic` element), and graphic frame "
"(`p:graphicFrame`) shape types can be a placeholder. The group shape "
"(`p:grpSp`), connector (`p:cxnSp`), and content part (`p:contentPart`) "
"shapes cannot be a placeholder. A graphic frame placeholder can contain a"
" table, a chart, or SmartArt."

"A placeholder on a slide can be empty or filled. This is most evident "

"A text-only placeholder enters \"populated\" mode when the first "

"populated mode when content such as a picture is inserted and returns to "
"unpopulated mode when that content is deleted. In order to delete a "
"populated placeholder, the shape must be deleted *twice*. The first "
"delete removes the content and restores the placeholder to unpopulated "
"mode. An additional delete will remove the placeholder itself. A deleted "
"placeholder can be restored by reapplying the layout."

"A placeholder appearing on a slide is only part of the overall "

"These three categories of placeholder participate in a property "
"inheritance hierarchy, either as an inheritor, an inheritee, or both. "
"Placeholder shapes on masters are inheritees only. Conversely placeholder"
