"Auto shapes are regular shape shapes. Squares, circles, triangles, stars,"
" that sort of thing. There are 182 different auto shapes to choose from. "

"Internally, PowerPoint stores length values in *English Metric Units* "
"(EMU). This term might be worth a quick Googling, but the short story is "
"EMU is an integer unit of length, 914400 to the inch. Most lengths in "
"Office documents are stored in EMU. 914400 has the great virtue that it "
"is evenly divisible by a great many common factors, allowing exact "
"conversion between inches and centimeters, for example. Being an integer,"
" it can be represented exactly across serializations and across "
"platforms."

"There are a few concepts it's worthwhile to grasp before trying to do "
"serious work with adjustments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/autoshapes.rst:202
msgid ""
"First, adjustments are particular to a specific auto shape type. Each "
"auto shape has between zero and eight adjustments. What each of them does"
" is arbitrary and depends on the shape design."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/autoshapes.rst:206
msgid ""
"Conceptually, adjustments are guides, in many ways like the light blue "
"ones you can align to in the PowerPoint UI and other drawing apps. These "
"don't show, but they operate in a similar way, each defining an x or y "
"value that part of the shape will align to, changing the proportions of "
"the shape."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/autoshapes.rst:211
msgid ""
"Adjustment values are large integers, each based on a nominal value of "
"100,000. The effective value of an adjustment is proportional to the "
"width or height of the shape. So a value of 50,000 for an x-coordinate "
"adjustment corresponds to half the width of the shape; a value of 75,000 "
"for a y-coordinate adjustment corresponds to 3/4 of the shape height."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/autoshapes.rst:217
msgid ""
"Adjustment values can be negative, generally indicating the coordinate is"
" to the left or above the top left corner (origin) of the shape. Values "
"can also be subject to limits, meaning their effective value cannot be "
"outside a prescribed range. In practice this corresponds to a point not "
"being able to extend beyond the left side of the shape, for example."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user/autoshapes.rst:223
msgid ""
"Spending some time fooling around with shape adjustments in PowerPoint is"
" time well spent to build an intuitive sense of how they behave. You also"
" might want to have ``opc-diag`` installed so you can look at the XML "
"values that are generated by different adjustments as a head start on "
"developing your adjustment code."
