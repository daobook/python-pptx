"Pretty much anything on a slide is a shape; the only thing I can think of"
" that can appear on a slide that's not a shape is a slide background. "
"There are between six and ten different types of shape, depending how you"
" count. I'll explain some of the general shape concepts you'll need to "
"make sense of how to work with them and then we'll jump right into "
"working with the specific types."

"幻灯片上的几乎所有东西都是一个形状；我能想到的唯一能出现在一张不是形状的幻灯片上的东西就是幻灯片背景。"
"有六到十种不同的形状，取决于你如何计数。"
"我将解释一些一般的形状概念，你将需要理解如何使用它们，然后我们将直接进入具体的类型。"

"This is a regular shape, like a rectangle, an ellipse, or a block arrow. "
"They come in a large variety of preset shapes, in the neighborhood of 180"
" different ones. An auto shape can have a fill and an outline, and can "
"contain text. Some auto shapes have adjustments, the little yellow "
"diamonds you can drag to adjust how round the corners of a rounded "
"rectangle are for example. A text box is also an autoshape, a rectangular"
" one, just by default without a fill and without an outline."
msgstr ""
"这是规则的形状，像矩形，椭圆，或块箭头。"
"它们有各种各样的预设形状，大约有 180 种不同的形状。"
"auto 形状可以有填充和轮廓，也可以包含文本。"
"一些 auto 形状有调节器，比如你可以拖动黄色的小方块来调整圆角矩形的圆角。"
"文本框也是 auto 形状，矩形的，只是默认情况下没有填充和轮廓线。"

"A raster image, like a photograph or clip art is referred to as a "
"*picture* in PowerPoint. It's its own kind of shape with different "
"behaviors than an autoshape. Note that an auto shape can have a picture "
"fill, in which an image \"shows through\" as the background of the shape "
"instead of a fill color or gradient. That's a different thing. But cool."
msgstr ""
"光栅图像，如照片或剪贴画，在 PowerPoint 中被称为 *picture*。"
"它有自己的形状，与 auto 形状有不同的行为。"
"注意，auto 形状可以有 picture 填充，其中图像“通过显示”作为形状的背景，而不是填充颜色或渐变。"
"这是另一回事。但很酷。"
